# Image Captioning using CNN and RNN with Bahdenau Attention

## Project Description
This project implements an image captioning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Bahdanau Attention mechanism.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an image captioning model capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant captions for images.

### Key Components
1. **CNN Feature Extraction**: Utilized CNNs to extract meaningful features from images, enabling the model to understand visual content.
2. **RNN Caption Generation**: Implemented RNNs to generate sequential text for captions, ensuring grammatical correctness and coherence.
3. **Bahdanau Attention**: Incorporated Bahdanau Attention mechanism to dynamically focus on different parts of images, enhancing the relevance and detail of generated captions.
